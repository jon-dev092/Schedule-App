# Project 5 Scheduler

## Scheduler Application
This application works as a daily scheduler and utilizes local storage save features in order to store your tasks. As a computer programmer your daily tasks can become 
clustered and hectic; This scheduler allows you to record those tasks and dynamically color codes each hourly row to aid the user in distinguishing between past, present and future.
Setting up you 9am-5pm work day has never been easier!
